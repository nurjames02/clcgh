              <div id="myDropdown" class="collapse">
              <!-- <h3>1. THE INSPIRATION OF SCRIPTURE</h3> -->
              <p>CLCGH, formerly known as Praise and Worship Center, was established in 1988 as an outreach conducted by some employees of Fountainhead Bakeshop. It was originally located in Barangay Luz as one of the five outreach areas led by Ptr. Dodo and Perla Castorico. They were tasked to serve as overseers of the ministry after their marriage in 1987 wherein it eventually became a formal church which was known as Praise and Worship Center Fellowship. It was named as such because praising and worshiping God were the members’ strength and unifying interest in coming together. The church started with ten people settled in a house on Cabantan St., Barrio Luz. For eleven years, God has blessed the church leading to increase in membership of committed followers. <br><br>     
                To address the growing weekly church attendance, Praise and Worship Center transferred to a function hall in Cebu Coliseum and stayed there for three years. On its 15th year, Praise and Worship Center went through tough challenges and financial struggles in meeting its financial obligations. This prompted the church leadership to move to a new venue. Since then, the church has been transferring and holding fellowship in different locations within the metropolis nine times. Despite all these circumstances and setbacks, the members remained faithful and committed to Jesus and the church. It never discouraged them but instead, pressed on towards fulfilling their mission to become effective witnesses of the Gospel.<br><br> 	
              Currently, the church is located in H. Joaquino corner Arcilla St., Mabolo Cebu City. It has been in the locality for over ten years now and has conducted several outreach ministries and community involvements like feeding ministries, medical missions etc. By God’s grace and enablement, the church remained steadfast and committed in accomplishing the Great Commission. It is for this reason that the church embraced and lived up with the G12 Vision then decided to change its name to CHRIST THE LIFE CHANGER GLOBAL HARVEST- Winning Cities and Transforming Nations. As a G12 church, CLCGH is committed to intentional evangelism and discipleship. As a result, the church dramatically grew in numbers with 1, 235 disciples to date and counting.<br><br>
              In addition, the church has established outreaches during pandemic while some churches met online yet it was this moment that God mobilized the leaders who went to their respective hometowns and started to meet house churches then became an outreach church of CLCGH namely, in Sogod, Clarin, Talisay City, Iligan, Bantayan Island and Ormoc. In addition to the existing church outreaches in Lapu- lapu and Barili, there are a total of 8 outreaches birthed in this church. <br><br>
              Moreover, the man and woman of God of this church was also promoted from pastor to bishop. God’s work and His Kingdom expands greatly. Aside from the outreaches, 19 primary leaders were promoted as local pastors while there were 5 newly installed primary elders to complete the 24 leaders of the church. The church was not only limited in ministering to its own congregation but also extends help by regular mentorship to many pastors and churches throughout the province of Cebu and its neighboring provinces like in Bohol, in Leyte and in Surigao. Through the years, CLCGH has been actively advancing the Kingdom of Jesus Christ through strategic and intentional evangelism and training with the ultimate goal winning the lost and making them disciples for Christ.	
              To God be the glory! </p>

        <div class="container mt-4">
          <h2 class="section-header hoverable-header" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#myDropdown2">STATEMENT OF FAITH</h2>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>1. THE INSPIRATION OF SCRIPTURE</h4>
            <p>We believe that the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, are the inspired 
              revelation of God to man. It is the only infallible and authoritative Word of God in
             all matters of faith and conduct. </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>2. THE TRINITY</h4>
            <p>  We believe in the unity of the one true and living God who is the eternal, 
              self-existent One, and has revealed Himself as one being in three persons: Father, 
              Son, and the Holy Spirit.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>3. THE PERSON AND WORK OF JESUS CHRIST</h4>
            <p>  We believe in Jesus Christ, God’s eternal Son. We believe in His virgin birth, His 
              sinless life, His miracles, His substitutionary work on the cross, His atoning death
              through the shed blood, His bodily resurrection from the dead, His exaltation to the 
              right hand of God. Jesus, as truly God and truly man is the only mediator between 
              God and humankind.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>4. THE PERSON AND WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h4>
            <p>   We believe the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity. He draws us to faith by 
              convicting us of our sins and by whose indwelling in the Christian at the time of 
              conversion enabled us to live a holy and separated life in the present world. We 
              believe in the power of the Holy Spirit, sent to bear witness of the Son and in the 
              work for the Christian’s growth and for the Church’s constant renewal in truth,   
              wisdom, faith, holiness, love, power, and mission. We believe the Holy Spirit grants 
              spiritual gifts to the believer to edify and build the Body of Christ and that it is the
              believer’s responsibility to use these gifts and develop them.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>5. THE DOCTRINE OF MAN</h4>
            <p>   We believe man was created in the image and likeness of God however, through 
              voluntary transgression resulted in the fall of humankind making them depraved in 
              nature, spiritually dead and hopeless and alienated from God, incurring not only 
              physical death but spiritual death, which is separation from God.         
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>6. THE DOCTRINE OF SALVATION</h4>
            <p>   We believe in salvation through faith in Christ, who died for our sins, was buried,
              and was raised from the dead on the third day. By His atoning blood, salvation 
              has been provided for all humanity through the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross. 
              The only way means by being cleansed from sin is through repentance and faith 
              in the precious Blood of Jesus Christ.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>7. THE CHURCH</h4>
            <p>We believe that the church is the body of Christ and the habitation of God 
              through the Spirit, witnesses to the presence of the kingdom of God in the present
              world, and universally includes all who are born again. We believe that the mission 
              of the church is to proclaim the good news of salvation to all humankind, build up
              and train believers for spiritual ministry, praise the Lord through worship, and 
              demonstrate Christian compassion to all who are lost and suffering.  
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>8. THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH</h4>
            <p> We believe in the two ordinances to the local church which are symbolic in their 
              meaning; namely water baptism by immersion and the Holy communion (Lord’s 
              Supper). We believe that baptism is an act of obedience to Christ and is 
              expected of all who have repented and believed. In so doing they declare to the
              world that they have died with Christ and been raised with Him to walk in newness 
              of life. We believe that the Lord's Supper is a proclamation of the suffering and 
              death of our Lord Jesus Christ, to be shared by all believers until the Lord returns.          
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>9.  THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h4>
            <p> We believe that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is the bestowing of the believer with 
              power for life and service for Christ. This experience is distinct from and 
              subsequent to the new birth, is received by faith, and is accompanied by the 
              manifestation of speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance as the initial 
              evidence.                  
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>10. THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h4>
            <p> We believe that the life of Christ will lead in fruitful works in the life of a true 
              believer. We believe that God expects believers to live a life of obedient surrender
              to Him. We believe that God has a perfect divine will for the life of each believer, 
              and that His will is revealed to the believer in His Word. We believe that the life of a 
              truly born again Christian will manifest the fruit of the Holy Spirit.                           
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>11. THE SECOND COMING OF JESUS CHRIST</h4>
            <p> We believe in the premillennial imminent bodily and visible return of our Lord Jesus 
              Christ to gather His people unto Himself and to establish His kingdom. It will include 
              the rapture of the Church followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to 
              reign on   earth for one thousand years and establishment of universal peace. 
              Having this blessed hope and earnest expectation, we purify ourselves, even as He is 
              pure, so that we may be ready to meet Him when He comes. Believers shall be 
              judged and rewarded according to their works. All true believers shall enjoy eternal
             and personal fellowship with God Himself throughout all eternity.                                  
           </p>
          </div>
          <div id="myDropdown2" class="collapse">
            <h4>12. THE FINAL JUDGMENT</h4>
            <p>We believe in the bodily resurrection of all humanity. There will be a final judgment in 
              which the wicked dead will be raised and judged according to their works. All who 
              have not accepted the salvation of God in Christ and all whose names are not 
              written in the Book of Life shall be condemned to eternal separation from God and 
             to conscious punishment in hell together with Satan and his angels, which is the 
             second death.
